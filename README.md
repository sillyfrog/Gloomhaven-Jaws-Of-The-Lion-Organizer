# Gloomhaven: Jaws Of The Lion Mini Organizer

This is the source code for the STL's on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4592102).

The code is horrible - and should not be used by anyone ;)

Unless you have the need, I would suggest sticking with the prebuilt STL's.

If using this, you may need to link in the MCAD library from OpenSCAD. On a Mac, this is stored at `/Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/Resources/libraries/MCAD`. So to link it in, you would run:

```
ln -s /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/Resources/libraries/MCAD
```

Obviously update the paths to suit your platform.

The `jotl-condition-tokens-tray.py` code is not so bad should you wish to make some changes.
